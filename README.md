# Horiseon Marketing Ageny Website

## Description

This project is for the marketing agency,Horiseon. It is a website that is  designed using HTML and CSS technologies.HTML defines the content of the website and CSS defines the aesthetics of it.

The webpage gives an insight of different services offered by Horiseon like search engine optimization, online reputation Mnanagement and Social Media Marketing.

The goal of this project was to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability and make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also,to rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

This codebase solves the web accessibility issue which is a major consideration for a lot of businesses.It also follows the logiccal elemnt structure independent of styling and positioning.Overall, the elements are organized to follow semantic structure and meets the accessibility criteria.

 While working on this project, I learned about semantic structure in HTML and how it accurately describes the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside it.
